# 👨‍💻 data-engineering-interview

## 🤗 Welcome

Hello dear data-engineer 👋,  
You will find 🕵️‍♂️ in this repository a Python exercise in 3️⃣ steps ✨.  
You can use all the libraries you love and are confortable with, as well as all the resources on the Internet (stackoverflow, etc...).  
The only requirement is that it is developed in Python 🐍.

## 0️⃣ Context

We will use an API giving us access to:
* a list of users
* a list of tasks (todos)
The goal is to fetch these data and extact insights from them.

## 1️⃣ Fetch users data

* Fetch users data from this endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
* Store it in a `users` variable  

## 2️⃣ Fetch todos data

* Fetch users data from this endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
* Store it in a `todos` variable  

## 3️⃣ Display the number of completed todos by user name

Here is the result we want to achieve

| name                     | cnt |
|--------------------------|-----|
| Clementina DuBuque       | 12  |
| Chelsey Dietrich         | 12  |
| Leanne Graham            | 11  |
| Nicholas Runolfsdottir V | 11  |
| Kurtis Weissnat          | 9   |
| Glenna Reichert          | 8   |
| Ervin Howell             | 8   |
| Clementine Bauch         | 7   |
| Mrs. Dennis Schulist     | 6   |
| Patricia Lebsack         | 6   |

## 4️⃣ Bonus: Display the completion rate by user name

Here is the result we want to achieve

| name                     | ratio |
|--------------------------|-------|
| Chelsey Dietrich         | 0.6   |
| Clementina DuBuque       | 0.6   |
| Leanne Graham            | 0.55  |
| Nicholas Runolfsdottir V | 0.55  |
| Kurtis Weissnat          | 0.45  |
| Ervin Howell             | 0.4   |
| Glenna Reichert          | 0.4   |
| Clementine Bauch         | 0.35  |
| Mrs. Dennis Schulist     | 0.3   |
| Patricia Lebsack         | 0.3   |
